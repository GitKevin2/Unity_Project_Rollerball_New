This is Kevin, I'll give you a little guide on the 
project.

Prefabs
=========
In the Assets Folder, you should see a folder named
"Prefabs". If you click on it, some objects will be in
there, these are objects I've set up to use in the 
game. For Prefabs all it takes is just to drag them
into the scene and for some of them dragging things
into their script in order. If you still struggle
then I'll try to help but I've provided a scene
with some of the most basic prefabs and a room.

Scenes
=========
In the Assets Folder, the "Scenes" folder contains
scenes that I've set up. 
 - MainMenu: was where the main menu is supposed to 
go, it's a placeholder for now.
 - MiniGame: Was the level where I was testing 
everything, what scene you usually see in the demos 
was the MiniGame level.
 - BaseScene: This scene I set up as a basis for a
level in case you needed a template to start off with. 
It has player, camera, input, the pause menu, HUD and 
even a room set up to which you can do as you see fit.


I may be updating this project on GitHub later down 
the line.
